            <h4>What did I learn from my research!</h4>
            <p class="text-left"> <hr>
                From my research I've learnt the best way to display response information is using graphs for repetitive data, For this I will use google charts.<hr>
                I really like the google forms design, they have a "card" design, for each question and response, I feel that this is gives a simple and clean feel. Following this
                I will use Bootstrap to style my website, This will provide interactive and responsive elements with rapid prototyping.<hr>
                All the websites didn't restrict the number of questions that a user can have on a survey, So I'm going to create a modular way of adding and removing questions to a survey.<hr>
                Zoho limited the number of responses in front of a paywall, to get access to the rest you would need to pay. My website will include no such restriction and allow unlimited number of responses <hr>
                All websites have responsive animation on checkboxes and input areas, this provides useful data on whether a input has be inputted. <hr>
                All the websites i've researched allow the survey to be given to anyone. I will create the survey page to be allowed to be sent to anyone to complete, Even without a account. <hr>
                Google forms is super easy to add new questions, I want to have different easy to read and click buttons to add new questions. <hr>
                All these websites have complex survey IDs, I feel these can be difficult to enter and copy. I want simple IDs so that users can find them easily. <hr>
                Zoho has this trial feature where after the 7 days features are disabled. This is highly annoying and I feel will turn users away if used, I won't be using these. <hr>
                All these websites give the user the ability to view each response as well as all the data, I will allow the user to view each response for more personal research. <hr>
                Survey Monkey uses the final submission page as a place to show ads, This is annoying and low quality. I want the website to remain high quality so will not include any ads. <hr>

            <h4>Overall!</h4>
            <p class="text-left"> <hr>
                From researching these websites I've learned what users will expect when they use a survey creating website.

                Google forms I feel does the survey creating best, The simple layout that I prefer over Zoho and SurveyMonkey, It doesn't try to do a massive range of features, 
                It's very concise and to the point, It's very simple with a high level of quality. The account creation is easy and it doesn't include any paid features. 
                The website is beautifully made and a lot of time has clearly been invested in making this finished product.  It doesn't try to restrict what the user can do.
                <br> <br>
                Survey Monkey is the second-best creator, It provides much more detail and features than google forms, but loses some of the streamline and simplicity as well. 
                While it does fill the gaps that google forms leaves, It adopts micro-transactions which in my opinion will turn a lot of users away and towards a free alternative. 
                Because of the added features, the website does become very confusing and not as intuitive, but they do deploy features such as tutorials and templates to counter this. 
                The layout is strong but personal I much prefer the look and feel of google forms. 
                <br> <br>
                Lastly, Zoho. This was probably the worst out of the research I did. It feels very similar to Survey Monkey without the attention to simplicity and care. 
                It feels like too much crammed into one space, Lots of questions are given but very little explanation. The layout was confusing and over-saturated, 
                While it does include some useful features, and questions types, the survey builder layout is not very intuitive. 
                The overall layout is much more detailed than the other websites, and I feel that the reason I didn't enjoy it as much was that it wasn't targeted towards me, 
                I think it's targeted towards businesses who want ultimate control and can pay for extra features.
                <br> <br>
                Overall, I personally rate them in order of preference of Google Forms, Survey Monkey and Zoho. Having such a range of websites that ultimately do the same task, 
                has given me a wide scope of what I should aim for and what users will come to expect in a website of this type.
