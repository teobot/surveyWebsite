		The layout of the presentation is very clean, They center nicely when moving from different platforms and device sizes. 
			Each question is separated by a line br, instead of the usual different "card" section type.

		Some of the question types include different animation for selecting and dropdowns, 
		    these are very responsive and make the website feel smooth and responsive.

		Creating forms can at first be slightly confusing, There are many different types of questions, 
		    Zoho has the most unique question types I've seen. Creating a new survey from scratch is really easy, 
		    They have numerous survey templates to use and get started covering a huge range of topics.  <br>
		Editing and setting up questions at first can be slightly confusing with many different options to tweak and change, 
		    However, they have really easy to follow tutorials to follow and start learning with. <br>
		    You set the survey title and type, You can also change the header and footer and even add a logo to each survey 
		    which both other evaluated surveys creators currently don't have.

                this would be good for applications where the user need to view each candidate e.g. a job application. 

                For a text/text area answer, Google has opted for a list of all the responses. 
                Multiple choice gets a pie chart, checkboxes get a line chart, and dropdown questions also get a pie chart. 
                Linear scales question types get a line chart, and so do multiple choice grid and checkbox questions. 
                Date questions get grouped by month and year, having the individual days within those months displayed next to it. 
                Time responses are similar to the date display method, with same hour answers getting grouped with the complete time displayed next to it.
